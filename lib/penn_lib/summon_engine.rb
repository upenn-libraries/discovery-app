  # The stock summon_engine does escape '+', but as of 20200930 it appears that
  # no matter how deeply you try to escape meta-characters, a trailing '+' still
  # results in a 500 error from the summon API. For now, we're reporting this to
  # Summon, and in the meantime assuming (likely incorrectly, but until
  # evidence proves otherwise) that this is the only case in which escaping is
  # not working correctly. This should be able to be removed once the upstream
  # issue is addressed, but should also be harmless to leave in place.
